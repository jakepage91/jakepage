                <p>Hey there! My name is Jake. I&rsquo;m a DevOps Engineer turned DevRel.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not what you would call a &ldquo;natural&rdquo;. I was a high school teacher in Spain, before I changed careers and dove head first into tech.</p>
<p>I remember while studying for cloud certs and playing around with dummy projects that I kept on having the same recurring thoughts. &ldquo;Ahhhhh, ok I get it know. If only somebody could have explained it to me like THAT!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that it was mostly my fault for struggling or not learning on the first try. Regardless though, I found that there were alternatives ways to explain cloud, networking, security, webdev concepts that would have made me learn quicker.</p>
<p>Finding these alternative ways and sharing them through blog posts and videos is what excited me lately. Even if you are a &ldquo;natural techie&rdquo; or a learner that is taking it slow. I invite you to join me for the ride as we learn and grow together.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>Jake.</p>
